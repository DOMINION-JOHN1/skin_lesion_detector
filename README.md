# skin_disease_classifier
## Introduction
Skin cancer is one of the most common type of cancer worldwide, with melanoma standing out as 
itâ€™s most lethal variant. Dermatologists often use dermatoscope as a diagnostic tool for skin 
diseases to visualize the underlying structures of skin lesions.
However, the availability of dermatoscope in resource-constrained settings remains a challenge. In this project we made use of computer vision to detect and classify
skin lesion into different classes and the dataset used is the popular HAM10000 dataset.

# Files 
The codebase consist of the following files
* Templates - It contains the HTML file that renders the frontend
* app.py - This file contains the main code for the Flask application. It sets up the server, handles HTTP requests, and communicates with the Model to get results.
* index.py - The project was also deployed using streamlit.
* skin_disease_classifier.ipynb - It contains the code for data exploration, pre-processing and modeling
